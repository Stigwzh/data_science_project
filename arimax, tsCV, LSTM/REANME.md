# Here I upload my models including history.
## The models I use can be divided into 3 parts:

* First, I run the basic auto.arima funciton to use traditional time series model;
* Second, I run tsCV function to get a better data, but here I only to get familiar with the use of cv;
* Last, I run the LSTM function. It performs not so good fot the limited length of our data.
* It is noticable that I run the LSTM by several different, and for the lack of the tutorails, I then choose python to run my model.
